      <p class="normal">A document doesn't need to have a single style sheet. You can give it a default style and any number of alternatives for the reader to choose from. 
      
            How the reader can select the alternatives depends on the browser. Not all browsers yet offer a menu for it, but many do. E.g., in Opera, Internet Explorer and Firefox you can find the styles under the "View" menu. As of 2012, Chrome requires an extension (e.g., Decklin Foster's Style Chooser). </p>
